# Droid typeface updated

Droid typeface was designed for user interfaces and electronic communication by Google Corporation and Ascender Corporation. This work is concentrated on fixing bugs in original design which seems to be abandoned. Google is concentrated on developing Noto project and Roboto. Noto Sans was made by stretching Droid Sans in horizontal dimention and doesn't look good IMO. Droid Serif was just rebranded as Noto Serif. Droid Sans Mono was rebranded as Noto Mono and received very little updates.

### Installation

Choose prefered fontconfig configuration and copy it to /etc/fonts/local.conf. [Hack typeface][1] is a good match for monospace font. Use [Noto Serif][2] if you need wide language support.
